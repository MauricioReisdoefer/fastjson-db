# JsonLite - Objective and Roadmap #

## Mission ##

jsonlite aims to provide a lightweight JSON-based database for Python projects. It is designed for small projects, prototypes, and educational purposes, where using SQLite or other relational databases might be overkill.

## Current Goals (v1.0) ##

- Simple CRUD operations: insert, get, update, delete
- Automatic unique IDs for records
- Human-readable JSON file
- Basic filtering by key/value

## Philosophy ##

- Keep it lightweight and simple
- Make it extensible
- Prioritize readability and ease of use

Futurely we will prioritize speed and performance improvements, including optional support for faster JSON parsing with `orjson` or other optimized backends with C implementations.
